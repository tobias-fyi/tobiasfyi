Tristan Mélia Trio - [No Problem](https://youtu.be/LZAft3xmwyE)

I'm getting a little bit of a casual-spy-at-a-dinner-party sort of vibe. I'm imagining a classy dinner party on the observation deck of a ship overlooking some amazing interstellar view or another. One other plot could be a group that is looking out over the same view from a different window, planning some sort of sneaky something.

---- ∫ ----

I want to get better at thinking smaller. Even one interaction between one character and someone/thing else can be interesting. It's all about the details behind / around the interaction.

CWS-003 | Setting ~ CitySphere October

Scene takes place on a CitySphere named October. A high-sclass event is taking place on one of the observation / event halls with unobstructed views of the planet.

CWS-003 | Device ~ In Media Res

The telling of the story begins in the middle of a sequence of events. Often, exposition (insertion of background information into a story) is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, flashbacks, or descriptions of past events.

---- ∫ ----

Using all of the tools above, I came up with the idea for the scene to start in the middle of a conversation between one of the visiting ambassadors of the planet below, Cometary Arsena, and a key player in the October sphere of influence, Olmon Mistié. Another character joins in later on, this one a minor player on the system-level of politics and the social hierarchy.

## Proximate

"You are quite a daring individual," The Opalian Cometus for Proximates, Arsena, said in a too-casual tone. She couldn't completely hide the surprise in her voice—nor the hidden smile behind the words. She did not turn her head to look at the man standing next to her.

The two humanoids stood facing a breathtaking view of Opalia, the fourth planet from the star Nymia, around which the CitySphere October now orbited. 

"I can forget that you said those particular words, in that particular order, just then." The Cometery sipped her drink gingerly, swallowed, and turned to face Mistié. Her voice level; controlled.

"Or, I could try to convince myself that it was a rhetorical remark." 

Olmon Mistié considered her, seeming to mull this over. Her eyes now contained ripples of a deep, subtle maroon around the edges, surrounding and mixing in with the shifting opalescent shades in the center of each. He had never seen anything like them—a rare occasion for someone like him.

"I have never met a native Opalian before. I meant no offense—quite the opposite, in fact."

"You understand, C.O. Olman, that your arrival has made my life of late rather...difficult. My people, nor those of the other Nymiatic do not take kindly to having this—", She turned her head in an arc, looking and gesturing with those inconceivable eyes at the Sphere around them, "—within the Opalian Proximate."

    CWS-003 ~ CitySpheres were a popular attraction for the locals of the systems they visited until one of them lost control of the singularity at its core and crashed into a planet in the Rozein System. Once the singularity connected with the mass of the planet, there was no hope. The entire system was essentially wiped off the map when every bit of mass in it was sucked into the growing black hole. Not only did 99% of the system's inhabitants die, but that section of space became uninhabitable.

Over the course of his galactic travels, he'd socialized enough with aniridic species to be relatively comfortable not knowing exactly where they were looking. This situation was no exception. He wasn't unduly bothered that he couldn't tell if she was looking into his eyes. If anything, it added to her mystique.

    CWS-003 ~ Aniridia: without iris. 

    CWS-003 ~ Olmon had appended his natural body with a series of drug glands containing various substances. One such substance, Set, would calm his emotions and allow him a more objective, distant perspective.

He made a show of carefully choosing his words. And, in a sense, he was.

Olmon knew she was the patient type. Speaking too quickly would likely derail the situation. The statement he made earlier had very nearly done just that.

"Nine standard centuries is a long time, though even eternity is not long enough to forget Rozein." He hoped he didn't come off as too cheesy or emotional.

He had thus far held off on releasing a dose of Set, a drug that reduces emotional impulse, into his bloodstream. Olmon had made a bold move, and wanted to ride this moment a little while longer. Being held captive by her nebulous gaze was an immensely pleasurable experience. He fervently hoped this encounter would lead to even more pleasure, and if he gave himself a dose of Set the enchantment would undoubtedly end. It was his last resort; his internal "abort" button.

She was right—he _was_ a daring individual.

At the center of each Sphere is a miniscule singularity—a black hole—that provided a theoretically infinite supply of gravity and power to the Sphere. The concept was popular at first. Spheres and the various attractions they carried with them garnered large crowds of locals from every society they visited.

Nine centuries prior, still-unknown circumstances caused the failure of one of the first-generation Spheres. Somehow, the myriad failsafes put in place did not prevent the Continent-class Sphere from crashing into a planet in the Rozein System. A larger singularity, yet still small on a galactic scale, is the only indication that the system ever existed at all.

Friendly relations between CitySpheres and planetary societies, such as those in the Opalia Proximate, had been virtually nonexistent ever since the Rozein Cataclysm—for good reason. Those that decided to continue living in the Spheres were forced out every inhabited system. Also for good reason.

---- ∫ ----

His City-class Sphere October had appeared, unannounced, out of the depths of interstellar space. Given the emotional and political climate surrounding Spheres ever since the Rozein Cataclysm, he considered himself lucky that he had chanced upon the Nymian System and not one of more hostile systems. 

He and the community living aboard October had grown accustomed to being turned away light-months out from a system, sometimes by force. However, the "defenders' had to be very careful with the amount of force they applied to drive the Sphere out.

Too much force could result in another Rozein.

Olmon said, slightly raising his right arm, palm up, in the customary Opalian gesture of gratitude. "We are—every one of us—grateful to you and your people for not running us off at first sight. You have allowed us to peacefully enter your proximate space—and around such a resplendent homeworld—a kindness most systems would not consider."

"You've already done us a favor which we could never hope to repay," Mistié said. He smiled broadly as he turned to once again swim in those pools of colorful quicksilver. "If there is anything any one of us can do—that includes me—to begin to repay that debt, please do not hesitate to ask."

He decided to continue walking the line. Bowing, he said, "I am at your service."

It had been a long time since he'd spent time interacting with any species outside of those that shared his CitySphere. His lack of practice showed at first—he'd laugh at the wrong time or miss the opportunity to express concern. As the evening wore on, however, he rediscovered the silver tongue that he once took so much pride in.

But she was the first of her kind that he'd ever met. There were bound to be cultural norms that he wouldn't understand without years of intimate interaction. Over the course of their conversation, he'd been doing his best at noting her every move and choice of words, mentally grouping them with any corellary emotion she decided to express.

"There is something..." Arsena said, he voice trailing off. There was something underneath. Olmon could not quite place it, though he knew what he _hoped_ the subliminal message to be.

Confirmation bias can be tricky sometimes.

"Will you share your technology with us? We have been trying to use a controlled singularity, as you do to provide gravity and power to your CitySphere. But we have not been successful as of yet."

Forcing his eyes to look away from Arsena's, Olmon Mistié drew in a breath and turned back to the view of Opalia. He did not want her to see the disappointment that had briefly crossed his face. 

The planet was nearly as enchanting, though he was not the type to have sexual feelings for inanimate objects. A similar spectrum of colors—shades of magenta and cyan, mostly—tinged the tips of the thunderheads. The colors grew more vibrant as his eyes swept toward the curved horizon which hid the system's star.

He could not risk this world. Even to guarantee continued relations with a being as exquisite as Arsena, it was not worth it.

The disappointment that had made his stomach heavy was replaced by a cold determination as the Set entered his bloodstream.

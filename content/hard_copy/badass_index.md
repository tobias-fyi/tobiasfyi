# Badass Index: A Definition and Explanation

> I've been a lifelong learner since before I can remember...

If you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd love to take you through a simplified model I
derived to help explain why this makes me badass. To start, let's define my Badass Index
for a specified period of my existence (`Xy`) as the product of my experience (`E`) and
skills (`S`) that I possess. Thus, at any given moment I can be defined as:

    S * E = Xy

    where { S = s_y + s_y-1 + ... + s_0
          { E = e_y + e_y-1 + ... + e_0

For each data point, the value of `s` and `e` represent the change in that input, known
as a "Badass Quotient", over the given time period. Thus, the calculated Badass Index
(`X_y`) will represent the change in my overall Badass Quotient for that period.

As a reasonably intelligent human with a deep, lifelong passion for learning, my Badass
Index is constantly being optimized. Currently, it is over 9000.

Furthermore, if the results above are extrapolated out to encompass the 10,---+ days
I've been alive, not only will you find my `Xy` in the 99th percentile, but it will also
be clear that my extensive repertoire of `S` and `E` make me a valuable contributor to
any team.
